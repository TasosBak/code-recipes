<h2 id="creating-a-new-repository">Creating a new repository</h2>
<p>You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the upper-right corner of any page, click <strong>+</strong>, and then click <strong>New repository</strong>.<br>
<img src="https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/2.14/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png" alt="new repo"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Owner drop-down, select the account you wish to create the repository on.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.<br>
<img src="https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/2.14/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-name.png" alt="repository name"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose to make the repository either public or private. Public repositories are visible to the public, while private repositories are only accessible to you, and people you share them with. For more information, see “<a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/setting-repository-visibility">Setting repository visibility</a>.”<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>There are a number of optional items you can pre-populate your repository with. If you’re importing an existing repository to GitHub Enterprise, don’t choose any of these options, as you may introduce a merge conflict. You can choose to add new files using the command line later. For more information, see “<a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/importing-a-git-repository-using-the-command-line">Importing a Git repository using the command line</a>,” “<a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line">Adding a file to a repository using the command line</a>,” and “<a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/addressing-merge-conflicts">Addressing merge conflicts</a>.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can create a README, which is a document describing your project. For more information, see “<a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/about-readmes">About READMEs</a>.” <strong>I would recommend leaving that box unchecked as it may interfere with the process of uploading an existing project from your computer.</strong></li>
<li>You can create a  <em>.gitignore</em>  file, which is a set of ignore rules. For more information, see “<a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/ignoring-files">Ignoring files</a>.”</li>
</ul>
